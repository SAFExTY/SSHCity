## Git organisation

We are working with the Vincent Driessen's branching model (git flow) :

|Folder                         |Content                                                       |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
|`master`                       |The current release, deployed                                 |
|`develop`                      |The next release, all new features, will be deployed          |
|`feature/*`                    |Work in progess                                               |
|`hotfix/*`                     |For fixing bugs in the current release (should not happend)   |
